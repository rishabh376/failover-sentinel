# Security - failover-sentinel

What we do:
- Trivy scan in CI - blocks HIGH/CRITICAL

- Non-root UID 10001, readOnlyRootFilesystem
- NetworkPolicy default-deny
- RBAC least-privilege
- Secrets via External Secrets / Vault (not in git)
- Dependabot + CodeQL on

Threat model: Teams discover runbooks are stale during the incident, not before it.

Reliability and safety go hand-in-hand: SLO guardrails, incident runbooks, and control-plane failure mode analysis.
